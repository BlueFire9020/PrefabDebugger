# SubnauticaPrefabDebugger
 Prefab debugger for Subnautica that allows modders the ability to view in-game prefab hierarchies and their respective components, as well as real time editable values for each component. Still a work in progress, but it does work in game currently, and most of the features function perfectly.

**Upcoming Features**

* Raycasting objects to view their components
* Reordering parents of objects
* Adding/Removing objects and their components
* ~~Show selected in hierarchy~~
* Add support for more components
* Change key to be a single function key
* Make the UI look much better (it sucks)
